clang and gcc have address sanitizer.
mypy: static-typing linter
function prolouge: inserted by compiler, inserted on the stack to have space for variables
tiered allocators: use a bump allocator for simplicity in setting up state for a more advanced allocator
least recently used page: clockhand algorithm: set a use bit to 1 each time a page is used. clockhand looks for next use=0 and clears any 1's found along the way
server tools: logrotate, fail2ban

awk:  conditional print has no if. $ awk '<condition> { command }' $awk '$5>0 { print $5 }'
c/++: ? has low priority be explicit with parentheses
c/++: have default case in switches over enums: and assert false to catch if the enum definition has been changed. and/or have a marker comment on each such switch
c/++: printf: pops values from stack if more %d, statements are given than arguments. Vulnerable to attack by user provided strings.
c/++: use const when there are output arguments with same type as input arguments
deb:  $ apt-cache policy <package> - shows available versions of package in all available sources
deb:  $ aptitude install -t testing <package> - installs a package from testing
gdb:  finish continue until function return
gdb:  rwatch break when a variable is read
gdb:  set <var> = value
git:  make a subdirectory into a separate repo: $ git filter-branch -- ...
git:  stash show -p: show patch information from stash
rust: iterator::partition
sed:  sed '=' <fil> prints file with line numbers
sh:   ${$1 + "$@"} "$@" if $1 exists
sh:   1>&2 redirect stdout to stderr
sh:   backticks are not literal inside ""'s - can execute subcommands
sort: -k6 -t' ' sort on 6th key with ' ' as separator
sort: sort --debug to help write a correct query on multiple fields
sql:  ' is used for string literals
tee:  write input to file and stdout

* streaming random selection:
pick a random element from a streaming array with no
information about total count. Pick the first element then for each (nth)
element select it with probability 1/n

* binary search short implementation (can be unrolled)
while lower != upper && step != 1:
    step /= 2
    if x[position + step] < target
    position += step

* conflict free hash
return (v + FACTOR) >> (32 - NBITS);
NBITS - number of bits in hashtable
FACTOR - a suitable number, this is found through brute force until no collision

* simple hash for telephone numbers: 10x10 matrix with last two digits as indices
perform exhaustive search among all results

* problematic null pointer case study
0: function(type * ptr)
1: type a = ... *ptr;
2: if (!ptr) {
    ... a ...
}
the compiler can take 1 as a guarantee that ptr is not null and optimize away
the check in 2. Leading to broken code. So the guard in 2 does not protect us

* Reproducible builds: (code -> binary is reproducible)
    - allows verification that binary is indeed built with the alleged code
    - allows caching and incremental builds

* Concurrent counter: sloppy counter
Each cpu has a local counter and a sloppiness/tolerance parameter S.
When the local counter reaches S a lock is acquired on the global counter and the local is 'flushed'

* Fisher Yates-shuffle
Index from the end of array, for each index randomize another position and swap the two.
Iterate until index reaches 0

* Swap/page daemon
Runs when fewer than LW - low water mark - pages are free.
Evicts until HW - high water mark - pages are free.
The batch eviction enables some optimizations.
